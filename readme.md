# Help
Hi, this is my first project with php and mysql if i did something wrong please help me and support this project and try it yourself and describe what exactly was done wrong, feel free to help us :)

Thank you very much
Loubexos

## Requirements:

Webserver and a mysql database

## How to Install
```bash
# Go into your webserver root dir
git clone https://github.com/loubexos/lishes.git
cd testing

# 1: Then open config.php and enter your database information
# 2: Now open the /setup (your.domain.com/testing-main/setup)directory in your browser to create all tables
# 3 IMPORTANT: Please save the configuration directory(your.domain.com/testing-main/config) with HTML basic authentication first, so that others cannot edit your wishes(own login is planned!)
# 4 PLEASE READ: If you want to change the path to your liking, change the name Testing-Main to whatever you want or move the list wherever you want
```
## Planned
- Administration panel login protection
- Custom currencies
- Color categorization of wishes
- some more...
